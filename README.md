# Python-Binance-Crypto-Trading-Bot

This is a Python trading bot that utilizes the TA-Lib library to execute trades on the Binance exchange. 

The bot is designed to perform simple buy and sell operations based on technical indicators. 

I created this project to improve my Python skills and with the goal of incorporating machine learning in the future.

The code is not well-organized and may be difficult to understand for those new to trading bots, but I am sharing it on Github to give an idea of how such a bot could work.
